#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems to ensure they function reliably and efficiently.

In the technology industry, software engineering is crucial because it enables businesses to create scalable, secure, and user-friendly applications. From mobile apps and enterprise systems to cloud computing and AI-powered solutions, software engineering plays a foundational role in digital transformation, automation, and innovation.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-60s)
Early computing relied on machine code and assembly language. The introduction of high-level languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and later C made software development more accessible and efficient.

Structured Programming (1970s-80s)
The move from unstructured, "spaghetti code" programming to structured methodologies improved code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Concepts like modular design and procedural programming (e.g., using Pascal and C) emerged during this period.

Agile Development and DevOps (2000s-Present)
Agile methodologies revolutionized software engineering by emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development. The rise of DevOps further bridged the gap between development and operations, enabling faster, more reliable software deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis – Understanding what the software should do.
Planning – Defining scope, timeline, and resources.
Design – Creating architecture, wireframes, and system specifications.
Implementation (Coding) – Writing and integrating the actual code.
Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs through unit, integration, and system tests.
Deployment – Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance & Updates – Addressing issues and enhancing features over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Feature	Waterfall	Agile
Approach	Sequential (one phase follows another)	Iterative (continuous cycles of development)
Flexibility	Rigid; changes are costly	Highly flexible; adapts to change
Feedback	Limited; happens after completion	Continuous; user feedback is incorporated throughout
Best For	Large, well-defined projects (e.g., government contracts, banking systems)	Evolving projects with changing requirements (e.g., startups, mobile apps)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Ensures software quality by testing for bugs, usability, and security.
Project Manager – Oversees the software development process, ensures deadlines are met, and coordinates team efforts.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Provide tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) – Help developers track changes, collaborate, and manage code versions. Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines – Use Agile practices, set realistic milestones, and prioritize tasks.
Code Bugs and Security Issues – Implement rigorous testing and conduct code reviews.
Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technology – Engage in continuous learning and upskilling.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual functions or components.
Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
System Testing – Verifies the entire application against requirements.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets business and user needs before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves designing effective prompts to communicate with AI models like ChatGPT. A well-structured prompt helps the AI generate relevant, high-quality responses. This skill is essential in AI-driven applications, content generation, and automation.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about space."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the concept of black holes, their formation, and their impact on surrounding space in simple terms."
Why the Improved Prompt is Better:

It specifies a topic (black holes).
It defines the scope (formation and impact).
It sets an expectation (simple explanation).
